Open-DVB
========

Open-DVB is an open implementation of digital video broadcasting (DVB).
The development takes place at Vodafone Chair for Mobile Communications 
Systems at Technische Universität Dresden. 
It is distributed under the BSD license (see LICENSE).

The purpose of this application is to serve as a benchmark for the MOUSE 
compiler system.

Currently, the signal processing portion of terrestrial transmission (DVB-T) 
according to ETSI standard EN 300 744 V1.4.1 is implemented. The system is 
able to send and receive with 2k carriers in 16-QAM mode. It runs under 
Matlab, Octave, and our Octave-Frontend.

# Description

Sample MPEG-2 transport streams for testing the algorithms can be found here .

Installation Instructions

Unpack the code. The distribution contains the subdirectories called 'dvbt', 'kammeyer', 'common', 'octave', 'matlab', and 'ref'. The sample transport streams create additional subdirectories in 'ref'.
For execution on Matlab, place 'dvbt', 'kammeyer', 'common', and 'matlab' on your search path. You may use the file 'startup.m' as a template.
For execution on Octave or the Octave-Frontend, place 'dvbt', 'kammeyer', 'common', 'octave' on your search path. Edit the file '.octaverc'.
Edit the file 'dvbt/dump_open.m'. 'ref_dir' is the location where testbenches look for reference data, it should point to the 'ref' directory included in the distribution. 'test_dir' is the place where many dump files will be created.

Now, you can run the following testbenches:

Testbench Name Description :

dvbt_tb.m					The entire DVB-T send and receive pipeline. This test requires the MPEG transport streams as test data.
scrambler_tb.m				Tests the scrambler/descrambler subsystem.
rs_tb.m						Tests the Reed/Solomon  encoder and decoder.
outer_interleaver_tb.m		Tests the outer interleaver/deinterleaver, a convolutional interleaving subsystem.
convolutional_tb.m			Tests the convolutional coding subsystem. It works with Kammeyer's Viterbi implementation .
inner_interleaver_tb.m		Tests the inner interleaver/deinterleaver, a block interleaving subsystem.
map_tb.m					Test the mapper/demapper. It performs QAM coding.
reference_signals_tb.m		Tests the insertion and removal of reference signals.
ofdm_tb.m					Tests the OFDM encoder/decoder.
gf_tb.m						Tests Galois arithmetics used by Reed/Solomon.
scrambler_prbs_tb.m			Checks the pseudo-random bit sequence generator used by the scrambler.
